## Fibonacci-Sequence-Writer

###A Fibonacci text writer to include large number values made possible using the "Big Int" feature in Java.

A key feature of this project highlights the usefulness of the memory storage Java can handle in certain cases. This file writer can achieve *very* large input sizes (input size being the number of lines you wish to print). By using the class Big Int from the Java utilities this fibonacci generator is able to correctly display values via any textfile you wish to output to.

####Result

A functioning fibonacci generator up to as many values as the PC of the user can handle. I have personally tested generated file sizes up to 100,000 input size.

####Known Glitches
- Exceptions may occur with improper user input of values
- Unknown files may cause unstable results
- *Extremely large input values (those greater than 100,000) will almost certainly guarantee Heap Space exception*
